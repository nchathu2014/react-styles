# Theme rolling with ReactJS
Example of how reactjs can deal with dynamic styles which can be improved to do theme rolling

Here if we can fetch the style file in a **remote location** automatically can be change the theme when the component is rendering.
Otherwise we have to change the theme as in the example.

# Run
use http server to test 
Ex: http://localhost:80/index.html
